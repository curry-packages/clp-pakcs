--- Library for finite domain constraint solving.
---
--- An FD problem is specified as an expression of type `FDConstr`
--- using the constraints and expressions offered in this library.
--- FD variables are created by the operation `domain`.
--- An FD problem is solved by calling `solveFD` with labeling options,
--- the FD variables whose values should be included in the output,
--- and a constraint. Hence, the typical program structure to solve
--- an FD problem is as follows:
---
---     main :: [Int]
---     main =
---       let fdvars  = take n (domain u o)
---           fdmodel = {description of FD problem}
---        in solveFD {options} fdvars fdmodel
--- 
--- where `n` are the number of variables and `[u..o]` is the
--- range of their possible values.
